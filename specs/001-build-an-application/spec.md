- Q: How should a user navigate to the "Category Management" screen? → A: Via a direct link or button on the main dashboard.
- Q: What should be displayed on the "Monthly Report" page when there are no transactions for that month? → A: Show "Total Income: 0" and "Total Expenses: 0".

### Edge Cases

- How does the system handle transactions with a zero amount?
- If there are no transactions for a month, the monthly report will display "Total Income: 0" and "Total Expenses: 0".
- How does the system handle the case where the browser's local storage is full?
