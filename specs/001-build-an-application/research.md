# Research for Expense Tracker Application

This document summarizes the technology choices and best practices for the implementation of the Expense Tracker Application.

## Backend

- **Decision**: Use Python 3.12 with FastAPI and uvicorn.
- **Rationale**: This stack was explicitly requested. FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python, and uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server.
- **Alternatives considered**: Flask, Django. FastAPI was chosen for its performance and ease of use.

## Frontend

- **Decision**: Use vanilla HTML and CSS.
- **Rationale**: This was explicitly requested. This approach avoids the complexity of a frontend framework, which is suitable for a simple application like this. The frontend will be served as static files from the backend.
- **Alternatives considered**: React, Vue. These were rejected to keep the frontend simple and lightweight.

## Project Management

- **Decision**: Use `uv` for Python project management.
- **Rationale**: This was explicitly requested. `uv` is a fast and modern Python package manager.
- **Alternatives considered**: `pip`, `poetry`. `uv` was chosen as requested.

## Linting and Formatting

- **Decision**: Use `ruff` for linting and formatting.
- **Rationale**: This was explicitly requested. `ruff` is an extremely fast Python linter and formatter, written in Rust.
- **Alternatives considered**: `pylint`, `flake8`, `black`. `ruff` was chosen as requested.

## Testing

- **Decision**: Use `pytest` for unit and integration testing.
- **Rationale**: This was explicitly requested. `pytest` is a mature and feature-rich testing framework for Python.
- **Alternatives considered**: `unittest`. `pytest` was chosen for its simpler syntax and powerful features.
