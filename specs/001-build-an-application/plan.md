# Implementation Plan: Expense Tracker Application

**Branch**: `001-build-an-application` | **Date**: 2025-10-12 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-an-application/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the technical implementation for the Expense Tracker Application. The application will be a web-based tool built with a Python backend and a vanilla HTML/CSS frontend. The backend will be developed using FastAPI and will serve the static frontend files. The focus is on creating a simple, single-user application with local data storage.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, uvicorn
**Storage**: SQLite
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: Web application (backend serving static frontend)
**Performance Goals**: Monthly summary page loads in under 3 seconds. System can handle 1000 transactions per user without performance degradation.
**Constraints**: Users can record a new transaction in under 30 seconds.
**Scale/Scope**: The system is designed for single-user operation and can handle up to 1000 transactions per user.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Code Quality**: Yes, `ruff` will be used for linting and formatting to ensure code quality.
- **Testing Standards**: Yes, `pytest` will be used for unit and integration testing.
- **User Experience Consistency**: Yes, the frontend will be built with vanilla HTML/CSS, allowing for full control over UI/UX consistency.
- **Performance Requirements**: Yes, performance benchmarks are defined in the specification and will be validated during testing.
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Yes, the backend code will be structured around the domains of transactions, categories, and accounts.

```

**Structure Decision**: A unified backend structure will be used. The `backend/src/static` directory will contain the frontend files (HTML, CSS), which will be served directly by the FastAPI application. This simplifies the architecture for this web application.
