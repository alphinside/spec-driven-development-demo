# Implementation Plan: Local Expense Organizer

**Branch**: `001-build-a-local` | **Date**: 2025-10-12 | **Spec**: [spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-a-local/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a local expense organizer application. The application will be built using a Python backend with FastAPI and a Dash frontend. Data will be stored in a local SQLite database. The project will be managed using `uv`, with `ruff` for linting/formatting and `pytest` for testing.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (backend), Dash (frontend)
**Storage**: SQLite
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Local web browser
**Project Type**: Web application (backend/frontend)
**Performance Goals**: As per spec (e.g., monthly summary loads in <3s)
**Constraints**: Local execution, no external APIs.
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user application.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Code Quality**: Yes, the plan incorporates `ruff` for linting and formatting to enforce coding standards.
- **Testing Standards**: Yes, `pytest` will be used for unit and integration tests, aligning with the constitution's requirement for comprehensive testing.
- **User Experience Consistency**: Yes, using a single framework (Dash) for the frontend will help maintain a consistent user experience.
- **Performance Requirements**: Yes, the plan acknowledges the performance goals from the specification.
- **Governance**: Yes, the plan follows the spec-driven development process.

```

**Structure Decision**: A backend/frontend monorepo structure will be used. The `backend` directory will contain the FastAPI application, and the `frontend` directory will contain the Dash application. This separation allows for clear distinction between the two parts of the application while keeping them in a single repository.
