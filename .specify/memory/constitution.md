# Spec-Driven Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
Code must be clear, maintainable, and adhere to established style guides. All contributions must pass automated linting and static analysis checks before being considered for review.

### II. Testing Standards
All new features must be accompanied by comprehensive unit and integration tests. Test coverage must meet or exceed project-defined thresholds. Critical paths and user-facing functionality require end-to-end testing.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The user interface and experience shall be consistent across the entire application. All new UI components and user workflows must adhere to the project's design system and style guide.

### IV. Performance Requirements
New features and modifications must not degrade application performance. Performance benchmarks must be established for critical user journeys, and all changes must be tested against these benchmarks.

### V. Domain-Driven Design
Code must be structured around business domains. The project should be organized into modules or packages that represent a specific business capability.

## Development Workflow

All code changes must be submitted via pull requests and receive at least one approval from a project maintainer before being merged.

## Governance

This constitution is the supreme governing document for this project. All other development practices and guidelines must align with it. Amendments to this constitution require a formal proposal, review, and approval by the project maintainers.
