# Spec-Driven Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
Clarity, maintainability, and style are not optional. All code MUST adhere to established coding standards and pass automated linting and formatting checks before being merged.

### II. Testing Standards
Comprehensive and meaningful tests are mandatory. All new features MUST be accompanied by unit and integration tests that validate their correctness and robustness.

### III. User Experience Consistency
A cohesive and predictable user experience is paramount. All user-facing components and interactions MUST adhere to the established design system and style guide.

### IV. Performance Requirements
Performance is a feature. All new features and modifications MUST be designed and implemented to meet defined performance targets for latency, throughput, and resource utilization.

### V. Governance
This Constitution is the supreme governing document for this project. All development practices, architectural decisions, and code contributions MUST align with its principles. Amendments to this Constitution require a formal proposal, review, and approval process.

## Governance

All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with the principles outlined in this Constitution. Any deviation from these principles requires a formal exemption request and approval from the project maintainers.
